# Tao (道) - Project Summary

## Overview
Tao is a minimalist puzzle game inspired by 2048, featuring Chinese characters representing the five elements (五行) that merge into higher-level characters and ultimately into "道" (Dao). The game combines traditional Chinese philosophy with modern puzzle mechanics and AI-powered gameplay.

## Developer Information

- **Developer**: Bob Tianqi Wei
- **Development Time**: June 2025
- **Framework**: Flutter with Dart
- **Architecture**: Provider pattern for state management

## Core Features

### Game Mechanics
